# FHIR Reference Server
> Provide FHIR Specifications

A FHIR Server with a UI, to provide CareConnect and NHS Digital FHIR specification artefacts.

---

### Features

- [HAPI](hapifhir.io)-based FHIR server
- Renderers to create user-friendly HTML versions of FHIR artefacts. These are output standalone as well as being inserted into the resource's 'text' section.
- Provides version-agnostic 'WrappedResource' facades for: CodeSystem, ConceptMap, OperationDefinition, StructureDefinition and ValueSet types.
- Best-guess functionality to identify a suitable FHIR version for a provided file.
- Supports HAPI objects for FHIR versions DSTU2 and STU3
- Utilities for linking back to HL7 FHIR documentation at appropriate FHIR version

### Requirements

Java 8 Runtime - [oracle.com](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
Maven - [maven.apache.org](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
Docker - [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
Bash - (for docker scripts - but you can build/run on Windows with `mvn clean package`)

### Quick Start (combined server/renderer application)

Combined server/renderer running as a plain java process:
```
git clone https://github.com/health-and-care-developer-network/fhir-reference-server.git
cd fhir-reference-server
git checkout develop
mvn clean package
cd server-renderer/target
java -jar server-renderer-*.jar
```

Dockerised standalone server and renderer:
```
git clone https://github.com/health-and-care-developer-network/fhir-reference-server.git
cd fhir-reference-server
# create tagged docker images for both the server (nhsd/fhir-reference-server) and renderer (nhsd/fhir-profile-renderer)
./build-local.sh
# create a dockerised instance of the fhir server (port and container name configurable, defaults to 8080, fhir-server)
./deploy-server-local.sh
# tweak parameters in run-publisher-local.sh to select an appropriate target repo/branch to publish
./run-publisher-local.sh
# Trigger the server to import the newly-rendered files and load them into the server's metadata cache
./clear-server-cache-local.sh
```

### Populating the server

Upon startup, the server starts in the background and a **dialog** is displayed. Select a directory containing FHIR artefacts then click the `Run renderer` button. Once the buttons are no longer disabled, rendering is complete. If there are any errors or warnings, a dialog will be shown.

See usage notes for the standalone renderer for instructions to render github commit history.

Any artefacts that were successfully generated can then be accessed through the browser-friendly website served at `http://localhost:8080`.

Repeat to add further FHIR artefacts. Use the `Clear server cache` button to clear cached artefacts down and start over.

Navigate to localhost:8080 in a browser. No artefacts will initially be present.

Various profiles are also available if you want some examples:
```
#### INTEROPen's CareConnect profiles
git clone https://github.com/nhsconnect/CareConnect-profiles-STU3.git
cd CareConnect-profiles-STU3
git checkout develop

#### Various NHS Digital project profiles
git clone https://github.com/nhsconnect/STU3-FHIR-Assets.git
cd STU3-FHIR-Assets
git checkout develop
```

### Combined server/renderer application CLI options
```
java jar server-renderer-*.jar [-p|--missing-ext-prefix string1;string2;string3] [-l|--local-domains string1;string2;string3]

-p|--missing-ext-prefix                 If an extension with this prefix is depended on but unavailable, the renderer will try to continue rendering without it
-l|--local-domains                      Local domains (for resources hosted on this FHIR server)
```
Options for CareConnect:
```
java -jar server-renderer-*.jar -l "https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/"
```

Options for STU3-FHIR-Assets:
```
java -jar server-renderer-*.jar -p "https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/" -l "https://fhir.nhs.uk/"
```

### Standalone Renderer usage
```
java -jar MakeHTML-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <source folder> <target folder>
```

Any supported files in `<source folder>` will have an HTML view of itself inserted into the *<text>* element, and output into the `<target folder>`. Supporting HTML artefacts are created in a subfolder of the same name as follows:
| File type             | Supporting artefact views                                      |
| -                     | -                                                              |
| CodeSystem            | metadata, concepts, filters, commits                           |
| ConceptMap            | metadata, mappings, commits                                    |
| OperationDefinition   | render (composite of metadata, inputs and outputs), commits    |
| StructureDefinition   | metadata, snapshot, differential, details, bindings, commits   |
| ValueSet              | render (composite of metadata and table), commits              |
| MessageDefinition     | metadata, focus, commits                                       |
| SearchParameter       | metadata, details, commits                                     |

N.B. StructureDefinitions specifying Extension structures do not get a differential view.

The tree view uses inline styles and Base64 encoded background images. It currently relies on NHS Digital serving FHIR icons.
If or when the XML file is then opened using a browser, the majority of the XML is disregarded, but the XHTML contained in the `<text><div>...</div></text>` section will be properly rendered.

This repo' also contains all the necessary in order to *dockerise* the project.
See scripts in profile-renderer-lib/Docker

### Standalone Server usage

To deploy this into the root context in Tomcat, you will need to edit the context in Tomcat's conf/server.xml:

```
<Context docBase="fhir" path="/" reloadable="true" source="org.eclipse.jst.jee.server:fhir"/>
```

Deploying in Docker
-------------------

If you have Docker installed, you can easily build and deploy this in Docker.
To create and start the Docker image, use the scripts in reference-server/:

```bash
./build.sh
./deploy.sh
```

By default, the server will look for files to serve in a bind-mounted directory at `/docker-data/fhir-profiles`, as specified in deploy.sh.
DSTU2 artefacts will then be served from `./NHSDigital` and STU3 artefacts from `./NHSDigital-STU3`, as specified in PropertiesFhirFileLocator.java.

## Limitations
XML is assumed as the input format.
Any existing content in the text element is completely overwritten by the renderer.
Many features permitted by FHIR are not supported. Including these features will cause the process to fail. This is to ensure that we do not accidentally omit/ignore information in the rendered artefacts.

## Disclaimer
No guarantee of correctness is provided. You may get benefit from the use of this, in which case, excellent, if not, sorry but we probably can't help further.
